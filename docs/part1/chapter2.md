# Chapter 2: Secrets in the Library

The interior of Ravenshollow Estate was even more magnificent than Evelyn had imagined. Vaulted ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and portraits of long-dead aristocrats gazed down from the walls. But it was the massive library that took her breath away.

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves stretched up three stories, connected by elegant spiral staircases and wrought-iron balconies. The air smelled of aged leather, parchment, and something else—something distinctly masculine and intoxicating that she realized was Alexander's cologne.

"Your grandmother spent many hours in this room," Alexander said, his voice echoing softly in the vast space. "She was researching your family history. What she discovered... well, let's say it explained a great deal about why certain bloodlines are drawn to power, passion, and mystery."

"What are you talking about?" Evelyn ran her fingers along the spine of an ancient tome. "My family has always been ordinary. Merchants, shopkeepers, nothing extraordinary."

Alexander moved closer, close enough that she could feel the warmth radiating from his body. "Your grandmother's maiden name was Blackthorne, was it not?"

Evelyn nodded, suddenly feeling breathless.

"The Blackthorne women have always been... special. They possess an magnetism, an ability to inspire obsession in those around them. It's both a gift and a curse." His gray eyes seemed to glow in the candlelight. "Eleanor understood this. She came here seeking answers about why men would do anything for her attention, why she could sense desires before they were even spoken."

"That's ridiculous," Evelyn whispered, but even as she said it, she remembered the strange incidents throughout her life—the way men seemed to lose themselves around her, the dreams she'd always had of shadowy figures and passionate embraces.

"Is it?" Alexander reached past her to pull a leather-bound journal from the shelf. His arm brushed against hers, and she felt an electric shock run through her body. "This was your grandmother's journal. She documented everything—the family history, the connection to this estate, and most importantly, the choice that each Blackthorne woman must eventually make."

"What choice?"

Alexander's smile was both beautiful and dangerous. "The choice between a life of ordinary safety and a world where passion knows no boundaries, where desire and power intertwine to create something magnificent... and terrifying."

As he placed the journal in her hands, Evelyn felt as though she stood at the edge of a precipice. The leather was warm to the touch, almost alive, and she could swear she heard whispers calling her name.

"What if I'm not ready for such a choice?" she asked.

"Then you wouldn't be here, Miss Sterling. The women of your bloodline are never truly ready—they simply have the courage to leap into the unknown when destiny calls."

The journal seemed to pulse in her hands like a heartbeat, and Evelyn realized that everything she thought she knew about herself was about to be rewritten.
