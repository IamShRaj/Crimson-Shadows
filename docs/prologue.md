# Prologue: The Letter

*London, October 2024*

The rain drummed against the tall windows of the Victorian mansion as Evelyn Sterling held the mysterious letter in her trembling hands. The elegant script seemed to dance in the flickering candlelight, each word promising secrets that could change everything.

*"Dear Miss Sterling,*

*Your inheritance awaits, but not all treasures are found in vaults. Some lie hidden in the shadows of desire, guarded by those who understand the true nature of power.*

*Come to Ravenshollow Estate at midnight. Come alone.*

*Your past is not what you believe it to be."*

The letter bore no signature, only a crimson wax seal depicting a raven in flight. Evelyn had received it exactly one year after her grandmother's passing—a woman who had always been shrouded in mystery, speaking in riddles about family secrets and forbidden love.

As the grandfather clock in the hallway chimed eleven, Evelyn made her decision. She would go to Ravenshollow Estate, not knowing that this choice would plunge her into a world where passion and danger intertwined like lovers in the dark.

The storm outside seemed to mirror the tempest beginning to stir within her soul.
