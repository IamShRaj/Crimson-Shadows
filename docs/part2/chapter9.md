# Chapter 9: The Price of Power

*Private jet, 30,000 feet above the North Sea*

The Gulfstream G650 cut through the night sky like a silver arrow, carrying its three passengers toward the mysterious Isle of Shadows. Evelyn stared out the window at the darkness below, her reflection ghostlike in the curved glass.

"Tell me about this place we're going," she said without turning from the window.

Alexander sat across from her, studying a collection of ancient maps spread across the small table. "The Isle of Shadows has been a sanctuary for women with extraordinary abilities since the 12th century. It was founded by a Blackthorne ancestor of yours—Morgana Blackthorne—after she escaped persecution in medieval England."

"Persecution for what?"

"For refusing to use her power to serve the Crown. Kings and nobles throughout history have tried to weaponize women like you. Morgana chose exile over servitude."

Marcus, who had been uncharacteristically quiet since their escape from London, looked up from his tablet. "I've been researching the Volkov Network contacts I made. It's worse than we thought."

"How much worse?" Evelyn asked, though she wasn't sure she wanted to know.

"They've already put out feelers through their entire European network. Your description, your background, even speculation about your specific abilities." Marcus ran a hand through his hair. "There's a bounty on you, Evelyn. A substantial one."

The number he showed her on the tablet made her stomach drop. She was worth more than some small countries' annual budgets.

"What exactly do they think I can do that's worth that much?"

Alexander's smile was grim. "They don't fully understand your potential yet. If they did, the number would be higher."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's not meant to be. The Blackthorne women have always walked a knife's edge between freedom and exploitation. Your grandmother understood this—it's why she spent so many years in hiding, pretending her abilities were weaker than they actually were."

Evelyn thought about Eleanor's journal, about the careful way her grandmother had documented her experiences while revealing as little as possible about the true extent of her power.

"How much of what I've experienced so far is normal for someone like me?"

"The attraction you inspire? The way people become obsessed with gaining your approval? That's just the beginning." Alexander folded one of the maps carefully. "The Blackthorne gift manifests in stages. What you've experienced so far is what we call the 'magnetic phase'—enhanced charisma and unconscious influence over others' emotions."

"And the later phases?"

"Conscious emotional manipulation. The ability to inspire specific feelings in targeted individuals. Some Blackthorne women have been able to implant suggestions that people believe are their own thoughts."

The implications were staggering. And terrifying.

"That's... that's a form of mind control."

"Which is exactly why organizations like the Order and the Volkov Network want you so badly. Imagine the applications—corporate negotiations, political influence, intelligence gathering. A woman with fully developed Blackthorne abilities could reshape entire governments without anyone realizing they'd been manipulated."

"But that's monstrous."

"Power itself isn't monstrous," Alexander said carefully. "It's how it's used that determines its moral weight. Your grandmother chose to use her abilities to protect other women, to help them escape abusive relationships, to give them confidence to pursue their dreams. She became a counselor and therapist, using her gift to heal rather than exploit."

"And you?" Evelyn asked. "When you worked for the Order, how did you use your abilities?"

Alexander was quiet for a long moment. "I used them to hurt people. To make them trust me when they shouldn't have. To break down their defenses so they'd reveal their secrets or comply with the Order's wishes." He met her eyes directly. "I was very good at it, and I'm not proud of what I did."

"What changed?"

"I met a woman named Catherine. She was nineteen, had just discovered her abilities, and was terrified. The Order wanted to recruit her, but she just wanted to go home to her family and pretend none of it was real." Alexander's voice grew quiet. "I was supposed to seduce her, convince her that joining the Order was her only option for safety and training."

"What happened?"

"I fell in love with her. Real love, not the artificial intimacy I'd been trained to manufacture. And when I realized what the Order really planned to do with her—the missions they wanted her to undertake, the people they wanted her to manipulate—I helped her escape instead."

"Where is she now?"

"Dead." The word hung in the air like a physical weight. "The Order doesn't tolerate betrayal, and they don't let valuable assets simply walk away. They found her two years later. Made it look like an accident."

The pain in Alexander's voice was raw, authentic. For the first time since learning about his past with the Order, Evelyn felt the full weight of what he'd sacrificed to protect women like her.

"I'm sorry," she said softly.

"Don't be sorry. Be careful. Be smart. Be strong enough to make your own choices instead of having them made for you." He gathered the maps and returned them to his briefcase. "The Isle of Shadows will give you time to fully understand your abilities before you have to decide how to use them. But eventually, you will have to choose."

"Choose what?"

"Whether to hide your gifts and live a constrained life. Whether to use them for personal gain. Whether to help others at significant risk to yourself. Or whether to become something new entirely—something the world has never seen before."

Marcus leaned forward. "What do you mean, something new?"

"The old bloodlines are dying out. The traditional structures that have controlled and exploited women like Evelyn are crumbling. She could be part of the last generation to face this choice, or she could be the first of a new generation that refuses to accept the traditional options."

Through the aircraft windows, Evelyn caught her first glimpse of their destination—a dark smudge on the horizon, surrounded by mist and legend. The Isle of Shadows looked exactly like its name suggested: a place where secrets lived and truths hid in plain sight.

As the plane began its descent, she realized that everything up to this point had been preparation. The real test of who she would become was waiting for her on the island below.

The thought should have terrified her. Instead, she felt a strange sense of anticipation, as if she were finally approaching the place where her true story would begin.
